### The term curriculum vitae (and its abbreviation CV) is also used especially in academia to refer to very extensive or even complete summaries of a person's career, qualifications, and education including publications and other information. This has caused the widespread misconception that it is incorrect to refer to short CVs as CVs in American English and that short CVs should be called résumés, but this is not supported by the usage recorded in American dictionaries. For example, the University of California, Davis specifically points out that "[i]n the United States and Canada, CV and resume are sometimes used interchangeably" while describing the common distinction made in North American academia between the use of these terms to refer to documents with different contents and lengths.
